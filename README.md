# rallus-coun-in-CZE
For estimating count of criptic species - rallus aquaticus in CZE using baesyan approach to enable updates.

The bigger scope is to present standardize technique for updating counts of any species data.

## Object naming convention

I am using 3 letter marks at beginning for naming objects, because after 3
letters u get scrolling menu in RStudio where i am working at.

So far i defined folowing marks within scripts:
* org = original, usualy oroginal data i am loading and renaming to work with
* dta = data
* fin = final object, usualy ment to be export at the end)
* tmp = temporary or assistant data object

Feel free to define any other category.

Needless to add, for follow-up naming i am using camel style (just under undersc
ore), just because i like it, no need to stick to that.

## Biger scope ideas

Advancing computational power enables a growing number of statistical outcomes.
Yet, standardizing data analyses remains challenging, limiting comparability. 
To address this, we adopt the principles outlined by [(Konkol et al. 2025)](https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/articles/5-123)
and employ a Bayesian approach, which allows for adaptable, comparable results and
supports a reproducible system linking species occurrence data to abundance estimates.
